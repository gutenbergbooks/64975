<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears to be a mania with some people to
criticise everything which comes in their way, no
matter whether it be the last new bonnet of Mrs
Smith, the pug dog possessed by Mr Jones, or
the last new novel by Mr Brown; and as a true
specimen of the ready-made critic, we might cite
those interesting individuals who, having more
time upon their hands than they can comfortably
get rid of, endeavour to dispose of some of the
surplus stock by subscribing to a circulating
library, and diligently ‘cutting-up’ and otherwise
abusing every author they read. Novels,
of course, are the principal dish of these readers;
and it must candidly be admitted that some of
the notes pencilled in the margins are not altogether
uncalled for; though some of them are
decidedly personal, not to say unpleasant; while
others, on the contrary, only raise a smile, and
if particularly ridiculous, are underlined by some
sarcastic reader, in order to call more attention
to the blunder, which has probably been committed
by some indolent and not very well-informed
critic.</p>

<p>But taken as a whole, this criticism, although
in some cases severe, is but the echo of public
opinion, and as such, is entitled to consideration,
no matter how humble the source may appear
from which it springs; and we know of nothing
more enjoyable than a well-read book, which has
been some ten or twelve months in circulation.
And such a book would without doubt prove of
great service to its author, could he by any means
get hold of a copy; for he would then have the
opportunity of judging for himself how his work
was appreciated by the public; and although
some of the remarks would doubtless cause him
annoyance, he should remember that they are
the candid opinion of the readers through whose
hands the work has passed. And if he has good
sense and a desire to please the public, he would
avail himself of those critical remarks which
seemed to be just, and alter the text in any
future editions. It is an author’s place to
write his work to the best of his ability, and
that of his readers to criticise it after it has
appeared in print. Whether the book be good
or bad, the author may be sure that he will
have a faithful and industrious army of critics
in the shape of subscribers to circulating libraries,
who will diligently search out all its little defects,
and display them in the margin for the edification
of the next reader, who in turn will try his
best to discover something which the other has
passed over, and triumphantly display it in a
similar manner. Although ‘the stone that is
rolling’ is said to gather no moss, it is a far
different thing with a novel; for the faster it
passes from hand to hand, the more and more
abundant becomes its crop; and at a seaside
watering-place, the writer has seen blank sheets
of letter-paper inserted between some of the
leaves, because the margins were already too
crowded, to admit of some reader adding his mite
to the evidence there accumulated!</p>

<p>This is why we suppose it might be advantageous
to an author to get hold of a copy of
his work which has been through a like ordeal;
and let him remember at the same time that his
book has probably travelled through the hands
of some people who are intimately acquainted
with certain subjects upon which it treats, and
whose opinion is not to be lightly passed over.
As some of the novelists of the present day seem
to think the law a machine which they can work
upon as they choose, without the slightest regard
to facts, it might be recommended to them either
to study the subject seriously, or submit any
notes which may appear upon this subject in
the margins of their works, to an experienced
lawyer; and in nine cases out of ten, the author
will find that the readers’ notes are correct. This
may be taken as a proof that people, although
they may pass rough criticism upon the characters,
situation, and general plot of a novel, are
not so eager to criticise points which touch upon
the law, physic, &amp;c., unless they thoroughly
understand the subject. As an instance of this,
we have heard of a doctor who would never read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">{82}</span>
a new novel by a certain author, because in a
former work this gentleman had murdered a
man in a manner which my friend described as
being ‘utterly ridiculous;’ for the poison administered,
and of which the character in the novel
died, would not in reality ‘have killed a cat.’</p>

<p>These remarks may serve to show that the
public, although they may accept a taking title,
a pretty cover, and a pound or so of toned paper,
as a novel, will also exercise their right of picking
its contents to pieces as soon as possible. To
show with what diligence some of them do so,
we quote the following: ‘The red rose actually
<i>died</i> the captain’s cheeks.’ The word in italics
is underlined in the book, and altered in the
margin to <i>dyed</i>. This, of course, is merely a
printer’s error; but it serves to show how the
circulating-library critic delights in ‘cutting-up’
the work of other people’s brains, and exposing
to the best advantage any little defect he may
discover. Then, again, in the same work, in
describing the scene of a shipwreck, the author
makes use of the following words: ‘Quantities
of chips, and pieces of wood, and bits of <i>iron, were
floating about</i>.’ The words in italics are underlined
in pencil by some incredulous reader, who
could not quite appreciate the joke, and took
this method of calling the next reader’s attention
to it. The words might have been a mere slip
of the pen; but, as they stand underlined in the
book, it is impossible to overlook them now.</p>

<p>A little farther on in the same work, an unmarried
gentleman is supposed to have made his
will, bequeathing all his property to friends settled
in the colonies; and his relatives at his decease
are disputing the same, when this paragraph
occurs, and is supposed to be uttered by a <i>lawyer</i>:
‘But had he lived to marry Lady A——, he
would surely have cancelled this will!’ Probably
had the gentleman lived, he would have
done so; but our pencil-critic shows that such
an act would have been altogether unnecessary,
by writing against the paragraph: ‘The act of
marrying would have rendered it null.’ This is
strictly and legally correct; and as the words
are supposed to be spoken by a lawyer, it shows
that the opinion of these gentlemen is not always
to be implicitly relied upon, especially when they
air them in a novel.</p>

<p>To turn now to the criticising of situations,
we find our amateur critic is quite as hard
upon them as he is upon the characters, and will
not allow a novelist to make use of situations
which it is scarcely probable would happen in
real life. A noble lord is forced through some
miraculous circumstances which would rival the
adventures narrated in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, to
associate with poachers, who are well known to
the police; and after some time has elapsed, he
at length regains the property, which has wrongfully
been kept from him by his uncle; and to
celebrate this happy event, he gives what is
styled in the novel a ‘levée,’ and invites thereto
the whole country-side, <i>including the poachers</i>,
and also the police of the town. Our critic could
not quite appreciate the novelty of this situation,
and therefore pencils in the margin: ‘Is it likely
the poachers would have ventured there?’ After
studying the facts of the case, and reducing the
subject to practical life, which is evidently the
meaning of our critic, and also bearing in mind
that the police and poachers were in the same
room, and that several of the latter were ‘wanted’
for various offences, we may take that bit of
criticism as sound.</p>

<p>If our voluntary critics will read novels, they
must expect novel things; but as far as our
observation goes, this is the very thing they
criticise most. They will not allow a young and
delicate lady to elope with a handsome Captain
on a stormy night with nothing to protect her
from the weather but a flimsy ball-dress, under
any consideration whatever; but feelingly suggest
in the margin that the gentleman should either
offer her his ulster or procure an umbrella; a
piece of advice for which I am sure the young
lady’s parents would devoutly thank them, if
they only had the pleasure of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>We might easily add to these examples; but
the above is sufficient to show that the novelist
who sits down to write a work of fiction merely
for the sake of airing an opinion, or to please
a certain person, neither caring in what language
he expresses himself nor how absurd the book may
be, may be sure of a warm reception when his
work falls into the hands of the circulating-library
critics.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.—SLANDER’S SHAFT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were still at breakfast when the postman
arrived, and Madge was surprised to find amongst
the letters two from the Manor. Both were
addressed in Miss Hadleigh’s large angular writing:
one was for her uncle, the other for herself.</p>

<p>As Madge had long conducted her uncle’s
correspondence, she attended to his letters first;
but remembering that still unexplained quarrel,
misunderstanding, or whatever it was, between
him and Mr Hadleigh, she discreetly kept the
letter from Ringsford back till she had disposed
of the others. These were all on business, and of
a most satisfactory nature: good prices for grain,
good prices for sheep and cattle, and reports of
a deficient harvest in America, whilst that of
Willowmere was excellent. Uncle Dick was in
capital humour, and disposed to be on good terms
with everybody. It is wonderful how prosperous
all the world looks when our own affairs are
thriving; and how merciful we can be in our
judgment as to the cause of our neighbour’s
failure.</p>

<p>Then Madge—sly Madge—opened the Ringsford
letter, and read a formal invitation to dinner at
the Manor a fortnight hence, on the eve of Mr
Philip Hadleigh’s departure.</p>

<p>‘You will go, of course, uncle?’ said Madge,
looking up with a coaxing smile.—‘And you will
break through your rule of not going to parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">{83}</span>
for once, aunt? You know we may not see
Philip for a long, long time.’</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy smiled, and looked inquiringly at
her husband. Dick Crawshay was not a man to
bear malice; but it was evident that he did not
relish this invitation. He was not frowning, but
his face was not quite so cheerful as it had been
a moment before.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ he said, rising. ‘I hate these
sort of things at Ringsford. They’ve always a
lot of people that don’t know anything’ (about
farming and cattle, he meant); ‘and when I’m
there, I always feel as uncomfortable as a bull
in a china-shop that didn’t want to break the
crockery. Certain, I have spoken to some young
fools that knew all about betting lists, but not
one that knew the points of a horse—except
Wrentham. They only want me there because
they want you, Madge; and if it wasn’t for you,
I’d say no straight off.’</p>

<p>‘But you mustn’t do that, uncle; at least wait
till we see what is in my letter.’</p>

<p>‘You can tell me about it when I come in.
That new reaping-machine ain’t doing what I
expected of it, and I want to give it a fair trial
under my own eyes.’</p>

<p>With that he went out, preceded by the dogs;
for they had made for the door the moment their
master rose to his feet, and as it opened, almost
tumbled over each other in their haste to be first
afield.</p>

<p>‘I hope he will go,’ said Madge thoughtfully;
adding, after a pause: ‘We must try to persuade
him, aunt.’</p>

<p>‘Why are you so anxious about this, child?
I never knew you to be very eager to go to
Ringsford yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Because I am about to disappoint Mr Hadleigh
in a matter which he considers of great importance.’</p>

<p>Then she read the strange letter she had
received from him, and Dame Crawshay was surprised
almost as much as Madge herself by the
earnestness of the appeal it contained. She was
silent for several minutes, evidently occupied by
some serious reflections. At length:</p>

<p>‘Thou knowest how I love the lad; but that
does not blind me to his faults—nay, it need not
startle thee to hear me say he has faults: we
all have our share of them. Perhaps it is lucky
for thee that what seems to me Philip’s worst
fault is that he has the impulsive way his father
speaks about.’</p>

<p>‘But all his impulses are good-natured ones.’</p>

<p>‘I do not doubt it; but that makes it the
more needful he should have some experience of
the world’s ways before tying himself and you
down to a hard-and-fast line. Nothing but
experience will ever teach us that the hard-and-fast
line of life is the easiest in the end. There’s
a heap of truth in what Mr Hadleigh says about
Philip, though he doesn’t seem to me to have
found the surest way of keeping him right.’</p>

<p>‘What would you advise, then?’ was the eager
question.</p>

<p>‘Thou must settle this matter for thyself,
Madge; but I will tell thee that there is one
thing Mr Hadleigh is quite wrong about.’</p>

<p>‘What is that?’</p>

<p>‘In saying that Mr Shield would try to keep
Philip from <i>you</i>.’</p>

<p>The emphasis on the last word and the curious,
half-sad, half-pleased smile which accompanied it,
caused Madge to ask wonderingly:</p>

<p>‘Did you know Mr Shield?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, long ago, before he went abroad.’</p>

<p>‘Have you never seen him since?’</p>

<p>‘Once—only once, and that was a sad time,
although we were not five minutes together. He
heard only a bit of the truth: he would not
stay to hear it all, and I daresay he has had
many a sorry hour for it since.’</p>

<p>She ceased, and leaning back on her chair,
lapsed into a dream of sorrowful memories.
Madge did not like to disturb her, for she was
suddenly amazed by the suspicion that once upon
a time Austin Shield had been Aunt Hessy’s
lover.</p>

<p>But the active dame was not given to wool-gathering,
and looking up quickly, she caught
the expression of her niece, and guessed its
meaning.</p>

<p>‘Nay, thou art mistaken,’ she said, shaking
her head, and that curious smile again appeared
on her face; ‘there has only been one man
that was ever more than another to me, and
that’s thy uncle.... But I’ll tell thee a secret,
child; it can do no harm. Hast forgotten
what I was telling thee and Philip in the garden
yesterday?’</p>

<p>‘About the two lovers? O no.’</p>

<p>‘Well, the man was Mr Austin Shield, and the
girl was thy mother.’</p>

<p>‘My mother!’ was the ejaculation of the
astounded Madge.</p>

<p>‘Yes. It was a silly business on her part,
poor soul; but she was cruelly deceived. She
had been told lies about him; and there were
so many things which made them look like truth,
that she believed them.’</p>

<p>‘What could she have been told that could
make her forget him?’</p>

<p>‘She never did forget him—she never could
forget him; and she told the man she married
so. What she was told was, that Austin had
forgotten her, and taken somebody else to wife.
At the same time no letters came from him.
She waited for months, watching every post; but
there was never a sign from him. She fretted
and fretted; and father fretted to see her getting
so bad on account of a man who was not worth
thinking about. He had broken his word, and
that was enough to make father turn his back
on him for ever.’</p>

<p>‘But how did my mother come to—to marry
so soon?’</p>

<p>‘She was kind of persuaded into it by father,
and by her wish to please him. He was a kind
good man; but he was strict in his notions of
things. He considered that it was sinful of
her to be thinking of a man who had done her
such wrong. Then Mr Heathcote was a great
friend of father’s—he was a deacon in our chapel—and
he asked sister to be his wife. He was
quiet and well-to-do then; and father was on his
side, though he was twenty years older than your
mother. Father thought that his age would make
him the better guide for one who was so weak
as to keep on mourning for a base man. He was
never done speaking about the happy home that
was offered her, and in every prayer asked the
Lord to turn her heart into the right path.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">{84}</span>
At last she consented: but she told Mr Heathcote
everything; and he said he was content, and that
he would try his best to make her content
too, by-and-by. Father was glad—and that did
cheer poor sister a bit, for she was fond of father.
So she married.’</p>

<p>‘And then?’</p>

<p>Only the subdued voice, the wide, startled eyes,
indicated the agitation of the daughter, who was
listening to this piteous story of a mother’s
suffering.</p>

<p>‘And then there came a letter from Austin
Shield, and he came himself almost as soon as
the letter. He had been “up country,” as he
called it, for more than a year, and he had been
lucky beyond all his expectations. But there
were no posts in the wild places he had been
staying at. He had written to warn us not
to expect to hear of him for many months; but
the vessel that was carrying that message home
to us—eh, deary, what sorrow it would have
saved us—was wrecked in a fog on some big
rock near the Scilly Isles; and although a-many
of the mail-bags were fished up out of the
sea, the one with sister’s letter in it was never
found.’</p>

<p>‘What did my poor mother do?’</p>

<p>‘She sat and shivered and moaned; but she
could not speak. I saw him when he came, and
told him that he must not see her any more, for
she was married. I wasn’t able to tell him how
it happened, for the sight of his face feared me
so. It was like white stone, and his eyes were
black. Before I could get my tongue again, he
gave me a look that I can never forget, and walked
away.... I found out where he was, some time
afterwards, and wrote telling him all about it.
He answered me, saying: “Thank you. I understand.
God bless you all.” We never had
another word direct from him; but we often
heard about him; and some time after your
mother went to rest, we learned that he had really
got married; and the news pleased me vastly,
for it helped me to think that maybe he was
comfortable and resigned at last. I hope he
is; but he has no family, and his sending for
Philip looks as if he wants somebody to console
him.’</p>

<p>‘But who was it spread the lies about him
at the first?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that we never knew. It was cleverly
done; the story was in everybody’s mouth; but
nobody could tell where it had come from.’</p>

<p>The feelings of Madge as she listened to her
aunt were of a complicated nature: there was
the painful sympathy evoked by the knowledge
that it was her own mother who had been so
wickedly deceived; then it seemed as if the
events related had happened to some one else;
and again there was a mysterious sense of awe
as she recognised how closely the past and the
present were linked together. Philip was the
near relation of the man her mother had loved,
and was to be parted from her on his account
for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>Who could tell what Fate might lie in this
coincidence?</p>

<p>She pitied the lovers; and her indignation rose
to passion at thought of the slanderers who had
caused them so much misery. Then came confused
thoughts about her father: he, too, must
have loved as well as Mr Shield; and he had
been generous.</p>

<p>Gentle hands were laid upon her bowed head,
and looking up, she met the tender eyes of Aunt
Hessy.</p>

<p>‘I have troubled you, child; but I have told
you this so that you may understand why I
cannot counsel you to bid Philip stay or go.’</p>

<p>A soft light beamed on Madge’s face; a sweet
thought filled her heart. She would bid Philip
go to help and comfort the man her mother had
loved.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.—LIGHT AND SHADOW.</h3>

<p>As soon as she found that Madge was calm and
ready to proceed with the duties of the day,
Aunt Hessy bustled out to look after the maidens
in the dairy and the kitchen. The other affairs
of the house were attended to by Madge assisted
by Jenny Wodrow, an active girl, who had
wisely given up straw-plaiting at Luton for
domestic service at Willowmere.</p>

<p>When clearing the breakfast-table, Madge
found Miss Hadleigh’s letter, which she had
forgotten in the new interests and speculations
excited by her aunt’s communication.</p>

<p>Miss Hadleigh was one of those young ladies
who fancy that in personal intercourse with
others dignity is best represented by the assumption
of a languid air of indifference to everything,
whilst they compensate themselves for
this effort by ‘gushing’ over pages of note-paper.
Of course she began with ‘My dearest Madge:’
everybody was her ‘dearest;’ and how she found
a superlative sufficient to mark the degree of
her regard for her betrothed is a problem in
the gymnastics of language.</p>

<p>‘You know all about dearest Phil going to
leave us in about a fortnight or three weeks,
and goodness only knows when he may come
home again. Well, we are going to have a <i>little</i>
dinner-party all to his honour and glory, as
you would see by the card I have addressed to
your uncle. Mind, it is a <i>little</i> and very select
party. There will be nobody present except the
most intimate and most esteemed friends of the
Family.’ (Family written with a very large
capital F.)</p>

<p>‘Now the party cannot be <i>complete</i> without
you and your dear uncle and aunt; and I write
this <i>special</i> supplement to the card to implore
you to keep yourselves free for Tuesday the
28th, and to tell you that we will take <i>no</i> excuse
from any of you. Carrie and Bertha want to
have some friends in after dinner, so that they
might get up a dance. Of course, in my position
I do not care for these things now; but to please
the girls, it might be arranged. Would <i>you</i> like
it?—because, if you did, that would settle the
matter at once. We have not told Phil yet,
because he always makes fun of <i>everything</i> we
do to try and amuse him. Papa has been consulted,
and as usual leaves it <i>all</i> to us.—Please
do write soon, darling, and believe me ever
yours most affectionately,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Beatrice Hadleigh</span>.’<br />
</p>

<p>‘<i>P.S.</i>—If you don’t mind, dear, I wish you
<i>would</i> tell me what colour you are to wear, so
that I might have something to harmonise with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">{85}</span>
it. We might have a symphony all to ourselves,
as the æsthetes call it.’</p>

<p>From this it appeared that Philip’s sisters were
not aware of their father’s desire to keep him at
home. There would be no difficulty in replying
to Miss Hadleigh—even to the extent of revealing
the colour of her dress—when Uncle Dick had
consented to go.</p>

<p>When the immediate household cares were
despatched, Madge sat down at her desk to write
to Mr Hadleigh. She was quite clear about what
she had to say; but she paused, seeking the
gentlest way of saying it.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mr Hadleigh</span>,’ she began at last, ‘Your
letter puts a great temptation in my way; and
I should be glad to avoid doing anything to
displease you. But your son has given me a
reason for his going, which leaves him no alternative
but to go, and me no alternative but to pray
that he may return safely and well.’</p>

<p>When she had signed and sealed up this brief
epistle, a mountain seemed to roll off her shoulders;
her head became clear again: she <i>knew</i> that what
Philip and her mother would have wished had
been done. A special messenger was sent off with
it to Ringsford; for although the distance between
the two places was only about three miles, the
letter would not have been delivered until next
day, had it gone by the ordinary post.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr Hadleigh read these few lines without any
sign of disappointment. He read them more than
once, and found in them something so quietly
decisive, that he would have considered it an
easier task to conquer Philip in his most obstinate
mood, than to move this girl one hair’s-breadth
from her resolve.</p>

<p>He refolded the paper carefully and placed it
in his pocket. Then he rang the bell.</p>

<p>‘Bid Toomey be ready to drive me over to
catch the ten o’clock train,’ he said quietly to the
servant who answered his summons.</p>

<p>‘A pity, a pity,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Fools
both—they will not accept happiness when it is
offered them. A pity, a pity.... They will
have their way.’</p>

<p>The carriage conveyed him to Dunthorpe Station
in good time for the train; and the train being
a ‘fast,’ landed him at Liverpool Street Station
before eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>He walked slowly along Broad Street, a singular
contrast to the hurry and bustle of the other
passengers. He was not going in the direction
of his own offices; and he did not look as if he
were going on any particular business anywhere.
He had the air of a man who was taking an
enforced constitutional, and who by mistake had
wandered into the city instead of into the
park.</p>

<p>He turned into Cornhill, and then into Golden
Alley, which must have obtained its name when
gold was only known in quartz; for it was a
dull, gloomy-looking place, with dust-stained
windows and metal plates up the sides of the
doorways, so begrimed that it required an effort
of the sight to decipher the names on them. But
it was quiet and eminently respectable. Standing
in Golden Alley, one had the sense of being
in the midst of steady-going, long-established
firms, who had no need of outward show to attract
customers.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh halted for a moment at one of
the doors, and looked at a leaden-like plate,
bearing the simple inscription, <span class="smcap">Gribble &amp; Co.</span>
He ascended one flight of stairs, and entered an
office in which two clerks were busy at their
desks, whilst a youth at another desk near the
door was addressing envelopes with the eager
rapidity of one who is paid so much per thousand.</p>

<p>No one paid any attention to the opening of
the door.</p>

<p>‘Is Mr Wrentham in?’ inquired Mr Hadleigh.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, one of the clerks
advanced obsequiously.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. He is engaged at present; but I will
send in your name.’</p>

<p>He knew who the visitor was; and after rapidly
writing the name on a slip of paper, took it into
an inner room. Mr Hadleigh glanced over some
bills which were lying on the counter announcing
the dates of sailing of a number of A1 clippers
and first-class screw-steamers to all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>The clerk reappeared, and with a polite, ‘Will
you walk in, sir?’ held the door of the inner room
open till Mr Hadleigh passed in, and then closed
it.</p>

<p>Mr Wrentham rose from his table, holding out
his hand. ‘Glad to see you here, Mr Hadleigh—very
glad. I hope it is business that brings
you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—important business,’ was the answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CURIOUS_ANTIPATHIES_IN_ANIMALS">CURIOUS ANTIPATHIES IN ANIMALS.</h2>
</div>


<h3>I. HORSES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> late father-in-law, a physician in extensive
practice, once possessed a horse named Jack, which
was celebrated for his many peculiarities and his
great sagacity. One of his antipathies was a
decided hatred to one particular melody, the well-known
Irish air, <i>Drops of Brandy</i>. If any one
began to whistle or hum this air, Jack would
instantly show fight by laying his ears back, grinding
his teeth, biting and kicking, but always
recovering his good temper when the music ceased.
No other melody or music of any kind ever affected
him; you might whistle or sing as long as you
liked, provided you did not attempt the objectionable
Irish air. One of the doctor’s nephews
and Jack were great friends. The lad could do
almost anything with him; but if he presumed
to whistle the objectionable melody of Erin, Jack
would show his displeasure by instantly pulling
off the lad’s cap and biting it savagely, but never
attempting the smallest personal injury to the
boy himself, and always exhibiting his love when
the sounds ceased; thus saying, as plainly as a
horse could say: ‘We are great friends, and I
love you very much; but pray, don’t make that
odious noise, to which I entertain a very strong
objection.’</p>

<p>Jack had another and very peculiar antipathy—he
never would permit anything bulky to be
carried by his rider. This came out for the first
time one day when the doctor was going on a
visit, and having to sleep at his friend’s, intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">{86}</span>
to take a small handbag with him. On the groom
handing this up to the doctor, after he was
mounted, Jack—who had been an attentive
observer of the whole proceeding by craning his
head round—at once exhibited his strong displeasure
by rearing, kicking, buck-jumping, and
jibing—so utterly unlike his usual steady-going
ways, that the doctor at once divined the cause,
and threw the bag down, when Jack became
perfectly quiet and docile; but instantly, however,
re-enacting the same scene, when the groom once
more offered the bag to the doctor. The experiment
was repeated several times, and always with
the same singular result; and at length the
attempt was given up, when Jack trotted off on
his journey, showing the best of tempers throughout.
Why he should have exhibited this extraordinary
dislike to carrying a small handbag, which
was neither large in size nor heavy in weight, it
is impossible even to guess.</p>

<p>On another occasion the groom, wishing to bring
home with him a small sack containing some
household requisite, thought to lay it across the
front of his saddle; but Jack was too quick and
too sharp for him. Instantly rearing, and then
kicking violently, he threw the groom off on
one side and the objectionable burden on the
other. After this, no further attempts were made
to ruffle the customary serenity of Jack’s rather
peculiar temper.</p>

<p>The same gentleman also possessed a beautiful
bay mare called Jenny, remarkable for her
sweet temper and pretty loving ways. She was
a great favourite with the doctor’s daughters, and
would ‘shake hands’ when asked, and kiss them
in the most engaging manner, with a sort of
nibbling motion of her black lips up and down
the face. She would follow any one she liked
about the fields, answer to her name like a dog,
and would always salute any of her favourites
on seeing them with that pretty low ‘hummering’
sound so common with pet horses, but never
heard from those subject to ill-treatment. But,
with all these graces, the pretty and interesting
Jenny had several peculiar antipathies, in one
of which she too somewhat resembled a dog
Wag (to be noticed in a future article), and that
was a marked dislike to the singing voice of
one particular person, a lady, a relative of the
doctor’s. This lady often went to the stable to
feed Jenny with lettuces or apples, and they
were always the best of friends; but so sure as
she began to sing anything, Jenny instantly forgot
her good manners, lost all propriety, and exhibited
the usual signs of strong equine displeasure,
although she never took the smallest notice of
the singing or whistling of any other person,
treating it apparently with indifference. One
day, as the doctor was driving this lady out, he
suggested, by way of experiment, that she should
begin to sing. In a moment, Jenny’s ears were
down flat, and a great kick was delivered with
hearty goodwill on to the front of the carriage;
and more would doubtless have followed, had
not the lady prudently stopped short in her
vocal efforts; when Jenny was herself again, and
resumed her usual good behaviour.</p>

<p>Another and very remarkable peculiarity of
Jenny’s was her unaccountable antipathy to the
doctor’s wife. If that lady approached her, she
would grind her teeth savagely, and try to bite
her in the most spiteful manner. What is perhaps
even more singular, she would never, if
possible, let the lady get into the carriage, if she
knew it. Jenny would turn her head, and keep
a lookout behind her, in the drollest manner
possible; and the moment she caught sight of the
lady approaching the carriage for the purpose of
getting in, Jenny would immediately commence
her troublesome tantrums of biting and kicking.
So strongly did she object to drawing her mistress,
that more than once she damaged the carriage
with her powerful heels, so that the doctor was
obliged to request his wife to approach the carriage
from behind, whilst a groom held Jenny’s
head, to prevent her looking round. Even this
was not always sufficient; for if the lady talked
or laughed, Jenny would actually recognise her
voice, and the usual ‘scene’ would be forthwith
enacted. Now, the most singular part of this
story is, that this lady was, like all her family, a
genuine lover of all animals, especially horses.
She was very fond of Jenny, and had tried in
every way to make friends with her, and therefore
her dislike to her mistress was all the more unaccountable,
as there was not a shadow of cause for
it. We can all understand dislike on the part of
any animal where there has been any sort of ill-usage;
but it is wholly inexplicable when nothing
but love and kindness has been invariably practised
towards that animal.</p>

<p>Jenny I am afraid was a great pet, and like
all pets, was full of fads and fancies. One of these
was certainly peculiar. Not far from the doctor’s
residence there was a particular gate opening into
a field. As soon as Jenny came near this gate,
she would commence her tantrums, rearing, kicking,
plunging, jibing, and altogether declining to
pass it; and it was not until after the exercise
of a great amount of patience and perseverance,
by repeatedly leading her—after much opposition—up
to the gate and making her see it and smell
it—thereby proving to her that it would do her
no harm—that at length she was brought to pass
it quietly and without notice. What could have
occasioned this strange antipathy to one particular
gate, it is impossible to guess, for, until she came
into the doctor’s possession, she had never been
in that part of the county, and therefore could
have had no unpleasant recollections of this gate
in any way. It is, however, possible that the
gate in question might have strongly resembled
some other gate elsewhere with which were
associated disagreeable memories; for I well
remember that, some years ago, I often rode
a fine young mare which had only recently
come from Newmarket, where she had been
trained. At first, she could never be induced
to go down Rotten Row without a great deal of
shying, jibing, and rearing, and other signs of
resistance and displeasure. And this was subsequently
explained by the fact, that the place
where she was trained and exercised at Newmarket
was a long road with a range of posts
and rails, closely resembling Rotten Row; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">{87}</span>
doubtless the mare was under the impression that
this was either the same place, or that she was
about to be subjected to the same severe training
which she had undergone at Newmarket; hence
her determined opposition.</p>

<p>One more trait of Jenny’s odd antipathies must
be mentioned before I conclude, and that was her
fixed aversion to men of the working peasant class.
She would never let such a man hold her by the
bridle, or even approach her, without trying to
bite him, and jerking her head away with every
sign of anger and aversion whilst he stood near.
But she never exhibited any feelings of dislike
to well-dressed, clean, comfortable-looking persons,
who might have done almost anything with her,
and with whom she would ‘shake hands,’ or kiss
in the gentlest possible manner. Of a truth,
Jenny was certainly unique in her odd fancies
and peculiar behaviour in every way; a singular
mixture of good and evil—a spiteful, vindictive
temper on the one hand, combined with the utmost
affection and docility on the other.</p>

<p class="ph3">A STORY IN EIGHT CHAPTERS.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> minutes later, Miss Brandon burst into
the room in her usual impulsive fashion. Lady
Dimsdale was standing at one of the windows.
It was quite enough for Elsie to find there was
some one to talk to—more especially when that
some one was Lady Dimsdale, whom she looked
upon as the most charming woman in the world.
At once she began to rattle on after her usual
fashion. ‘Thank goodness, those hateful exercises
are over for to-day. Dulce et decorum est pro
patria mori. Arma virumque cano. How I do
detest Latin! My grandmother didn’t know
a word of it, and she was the most delightful
old lady I ever knew. Besides, where’s the use
of it? When Charley and I are married, I can’t
talk to him in Latin—nor even to the butcher’s
boy, nor the fishmonger. Perhaps, if I were to
speak to my poodle in dog-Latin, he might understand
me.’ Then, with a sudden change of
manner, she said: ‘Dear Lady Dimsdale, what
is the matter?’ for Laura had turned, and the
traces of tears were still visible around her eyes.
‘Why, I do believe you have been’——</p>

<p>‘Yes, crying—that’s the only word for it,’
answered Laura with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Do tell me what it is. Nothing serious?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing more serious than the last chapter
of a foolish love-story.’ She had taken up a
book instinctively.</p>

<p>‘I’m awfully glad it’s nothing worse. Love-stories
that make one cry are delicious. I always
feel better after a good cry.’ Her sharp eyes were
glancing over the title of the book in Lady
Dimsdale’s hand. ‘“Buchan’s <i>Domestic Medicine</i>,”’
she read out aloud. ‘Dear Lady Dimsdale, surely
this is not the book that’—— She was suddenly
silent. The room had a bow-window, the casement
of which stood wide open this sunny
morning. Elsie had heard voices on the terrace
outside. ‘That’s dear old nunky’s voice,’ she
said. ‘And—yes—no—I do believe it is though!’
She crossed to the window and peeped out from
behind the curtains.</p>

<p>Stumping slowly along the terrace, assisted by
his thick Malacca, came Captain Bowood. By
his side marched a dark-bearded military-looking
inspector of police, dressed in the regulation blue
braided frock-coat and peaked cap. They were
engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>‘An inspector of police! What can be the
matter? I do believe they are coming here.’
So spoke Elsie; but when she looked round,
expecting a response, she found herself alone.
Lady Dimsdale had slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>The voices came nearer. Elsie seated herself
at the table, opened a book, ruffled her hair, and
pretended to be poring over her lessons.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Captain Bowood, followed
by the inspector, entered the room. ‘Pheugh!
Enough to frizzle a nigger,’ ejaculated the former,
as he mopped his forehead with his yellow
bandana handkerchief. Then perceiving Elsie,
he said, as he pinched one of her ears, ‘Ha,
Poppet, you here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, nunky; and dreadfully puzzled I am.
I want to find out in what year the Great
Pyramid was built. Do, please, tell me.’</p>

<p>‘Ha, ha!—Listen to that, Mr Inspector.—If
you had asked me the distance from here to
New York, now. Great Pyramid, eh?’</p>

<p>The inspector, pencil and notebook in hand,
was examining the fastenings of the window.
‘Very insecure, Captain Bowood,’ he said; ‘very
insecure indeed. A burglar would make short
work of them.’</p>

<p>Miss Brandon was eying him furtively. There
was a puzzled look on her face. ‘I could almost
swear it was Charley’s voice; and yet’——</p>

<p>‘Come, come; you’ll frighten us out of our
wits, if you talk like that,’ answered the Captain.</p>

<p>‘Many burglaries in this neighbourhood of
late,’ remarked the inspector sententiously.</p>

<p>‘Just so, just so.’ This was said a little
uneasily.</p>

<p>‘Best to warn you in time, sir.’</p>

<p>‘O Charley, you naughty, naughty boy!’
remarked Miss Brandon under her breath. ‘Even
I did not know him at first.’</p>

<p>‘But if Mr Burglar chooses to pay us a visit,
who’s to hinder him?’ asked the Captain.</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders and
smiled an inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say that they intend to
pay us a visit to-night? Come now.’</p>

<p>‘Every reason to believe so, Captain.’</p>

<p>‘But, confound it! how do you know all
this?’</p>

<p>‘Secret information. Know many things. Mrs
Bowood keeps her jewel-case in top left-hand
drawer in her dressing-room. Know that.’</p>

<p>‘Bless my heart! How did you find that out?’</p>

<p>‘Secret information. Gold chronometer with
inscription on it hidden away at the bottom of
your writing-desk. Know that.’</p>

<p>‘How the’——</p>

<p>‘Secret information.’</p>

<p>‘O Charley, Charley, you artful darling!’—this
<i>sotto voce</i> from Miss Brandon.</p>

<p>The Captain looked bewildered, as well he
might. ‘This is really most wonderful,’ he said.
‘But about those rascals who, you say, are going
to visit us to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Give ’em a warm reception, Captain. Leave
that to me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">{88}</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, yes. Warm reception. Good. Have
some of your men in hiding, eh, Mr Inspector?’</p>

<p>‘Half a dozen of ’em, Captain.’</p>

<p>‘Just so, just so. And I’ll be in hiding too.
I’ve a horse-pistol up-stairs nearly as long as my
arm.’</p>

<p>‘Shan’t need that, sir.’</p>

<p>‘No good having a horse-pistol if one doesn’t
make use of it now and then.’</p>

<p>‘Half-a-dozen men—three inside the house, and
three out,’ remarked the inspector as he wrote
down the particulars in his book.</p>

<p>‘And I’ll make the seventh—don’t forget
that!’ cried the Captain, looking as fierce as some
buccaneer of bygone days. ‘If there’s one among
the burglars more savage than the rest, leave him
for me to tackle.’</p>

<p>‘My poor, dear nunky, if you only knew!’
murmured Elsie under her breath.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I had better lend you a pair of these,
Captain; they might prove useful in a scuffle,’
remarked the inspector as he produced a pair of
handcuffs from the tail-pocket of his coat. ‘The
simplest bracelets in the world. The easiest to
get on, and the most difficult to get off—till you
know how. Allow me. This is how it’s done.
What could be more simple?’</p>

<p>Nothing apparently could be more simple,
seeing that, before Captain Bowood knew what had
happened, he found himself securely handcuffed.</p>

<p>‘Ha, ha—just so. Queer sensation—very,’ he
exclaimed, turning redder in the face than usual.
‘But I don’t care how soon you take them off,
Mr Inspector.’</p>

<p>‘No hurry, Captain, no hurry.’</p>

<p>‘Confound you! what do you mean by no
hurry? What’—— But here the Captain came
to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>The inspector’s black wig and whiskers had
vanished, and the laughingly impudent features
of his peccant nephew were revealed to his
astonished gaze.</p>

<p>‘Good-afternoon, my dear uncle. This is the
second time to-day that I have had the pleasure
of seeing you.’ Then he called: ‘Elsie, dear!’</p>

<p>‘Here I am, Charley,’ came in immediate
response.</p>

<p>‘Come and kiss me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Charley.’ And with that Miss Brandon
rose from her chair, and with a slightly heightened
colour and the demurest air possible, came down
the room and allowed her lover to lightly touch
her lips with his. It was a pretty picture.</p>

<p>‘What—what! Why—why,’ spluttered the
Captain. For a little while words seemed to
desert him.</p>

<p>‘My dear uncle, pray, <i>pray</i>, do not allow
yourself to get quite so red in the face; at your
time of life you really alarm me.’</p>

<p>‘You—you vile young jackanapes! You—you
cockatrice!—And you, miss, you shall smart for
this. I’ll—I’ll—— Oh!’</p>

<p>‘Patience, good uncle; prithee, patience.’</p>

<p>‘Patience! O for a good horsewhip!’</p>

<p>‘When I called upon you this morning, sir,’
resumed Charles the imperturbable, ‘I left unsaid
the most important part of that which I had
come to say; it therefore became needful that
I should see you again.’</p>

<p>‘O for a horsewhip! Are you going to take
these things off me, or are you not?’</p>

<p>‘The object of my second visit, sir, is to inform
you that Miss Brandon and I are engaged to be
married, and to beg of you to give us your consent
and blessing, and make two simple young creatures
happy.’</p>

<p>‘Handcuffed like a common poacher on his way
to jail! Oh, when once I get free!’</p>

<p>‘We have made up our minds to get married;
haven’t we, Elsie?’</p>

<p>‘We have—or else to die together,’ replied
Miss Brandon, as she struck a little tragic
attitude.</p>

<p>‘Think over what I have said, my dear uncle,
and accord us your consent.’</p>

<p>‘Or our deaths will lie at your door.’</p>

<p>‘Every night as the clock struck twelve, you
would see us by your side.’</p>

<p>‘You would never more enjoy your rum-and-water
and your pipe.’</p>

<p>‘I should tickle your ear with a ghostly feather,
and wake you in the middle of your first sleep.’</p>

<p>‘I shall go crazy—crazy!’ spluttered the
Captain. He would have stamped his foot, only
he was afraid of the gout.</p>

<p>‘Not quite, sir, I hope,’ replied young Summers,
with a sudden change of manner; and next
moment, and without any action of his own in
the matter, the Captain found himself a free
man. The first thing he did was to make a
sudden grasp at his cane; but Elsie was too
quick for him, or it might have fared ill with
her sweetheart.</p>

<p>Master Charley laughed. ‘I am sorry, my
dear uncle, to have to leave you now; but time
is pressing. You will not forget what I have
said, I feel sure. I shall look for your answer to
my request in the course of three or four days;
or would you prefer, sir, that I should wait upon
you for it in person?’</p>

<p>‘If you ever dare to set foot inside my door
again, I’ll—I’ll spiflicate you—yes, sir, spiflicate
you!’</p>

<p>‘To what a terrible fate you doom me, good
my lord!—Come, Elsie, you may as well walk
with me through the shrubbery.’</p>

<p>Miss Brandon going up suddenly to Captain
Bowood, flung her arms round his neck and
kissed him impulsively. ‘You dear, crusty,
cantankerous, kind-hearted old thing, I can’t
help loving you!’ she cried.</p>

<p>‘Go along, you baggage. As bad as he is—every
bit. Go along.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Au revoir</i>, uncle,’ said Mr Summers with his
most courtly stage bow. ‘We shall meet again—at
Philippi.’</p>

<p>A moment later, Captain Bowood found himself
alone. ‘There’s impudence!’ he exclaimed. ‘It’s
worse than that; it’s cheek—downright cheek.
Never bamboozled like it before. Handcuffed!
What an old nincompoop I must have looked!
Good thing Sir Frederick or any of the others
didn’t see me. I should never have heard the
last of it.’ With that, the last trace of ill-humour
vanished, and he burst into a hearty, sailor-like
guffaw. ‘Just the sort of trick I should have
gloried in when I was a young spark!’ He rose
from his chair, took his cane in his hand, and
limped as far as the window, his gout being rather
troublesome this afternoon. ‘So, so. There they
go, arm in arm. Who would have thought of
Don Carlos falling in love with Miss Saucebox?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">{89}</span>
But I don’t know that he could do better. She’s
a good girl—a little flighty just now; but that
will cure itself by-and-by—and she will have
a nice little property when she comes of age.
Must pretend to set my face against it, though,
and that will be sure to make them fonder of
one another. Ha, ha! we old sea-dogs know a
thing or two.’ And with that the Captain winked
confidentially to himself two or three times and
went about his business.</p>

<p class="p2">When Sir Frederick Pinkerton followed Mrs
Bowood and Mrs Boyd out of the room where
the interview had taken place, and left Lady
Dimsdale sitting there alone, he quitted the house
at once, and sauntered in his usual gingerly
fashion through the flower-garden to an unfrequented
part of the grounds known as the
Holly Walk, where there was not much likelihood
of his being interrupted. Like Lady Dimsdale, he
wanted to be alone. Just then, he had much to
occupy his thoughts. To and fro he paced the
walk slowly and musingly, his hands behind his
back, his eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p>‘What tempts me to do this thing?’ he asked
himself, not once, but several times. ‘That I
dislike the man is quite certain; why, then, take
upon myself to interfere between this woman and
him? Certainly I have nothing to thank Oscar
Boyd for; why, then, mix myself up in a matter
that concerns me no more than it concerns the
man in the moon? If he had not appeared on
the scene just when he did, I might perhaps have
won Lady Dimsdale for my wife. But now? Too
late—too late! Even when he and this woman
shall have gone their way, he will live in my
lady’s memory, never probably to be forgotten.
He is her hero of romance. That he made love
to her in years gone by, when they were young
together, there is little doubt; that he made love
to her again this morning, and met with no such
rebuff as I did, seems equally clear; and though
she knows now that he can never become her
husband, yet she on her side will never forget
him. In what way, then, am I called upon to
interfere in his affairs? Should I not be a fool
for my pains? And yet to let that woman claim
him as her own, when a word from me would—— No!
<i>Noblesse oblige.</i> What should I think of
myself in years to come, if I were to permit this
man’s life to be blasted by so cruel a fraud? The
thought would hardly be a pleasant one on one’s
deathbed.’ He shrugged his shoulders, and went
on slowly pacing the Holly Walk. At length he
raised his head and said half aloud: ‘I will do
it, and at once; but it shall be on my own
conditions, Lady Dimsdale—on my own conditions.’</p>

<p>There was a gardener at work some distance
away. He called the man to him, and sent him
with a message to the house. Ten minutes later,
Lady Dimsdale entered the Holly Walk.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick approached her with one of his
most elaborate bows.</p>

<p>‘You wish to see me, Sir Frederick?’ she said
inquiringly, but a little doubtfully. She hoped
that he was not about to re-open the subject
that had been discussed between them earlier in
the day.</p>

<p>‘I have taken the liberty of asking you to
favour me with your company for a few minutes—here,
where we shall be safe from interruption.
The matter I am desirous of consulting you upon
admits of no delay.’</p>

<p>She bowed, but said nothing. His words
reassured her on one point, while filling her
with a vague uneasiness. The sunshade she held
over her head was lined with pink; it served its
purpose in preventing the Baronet from detecting
how pale and wan was the face under it.</p>

<p>They began to pace the walk slowly side by
side.</p>

<p>‘Equally with others, Lady Dimsdale, you are
aware that, by a strange turn of fortune, Mr Boyd’s
wife, whom he believed to have been dead for
several years, has this morning reappeared?’</p>

<p>‘You were in the parlour, Sir Frederick, when
I was introduced to Mrs Boyd only half an hour
ago.’ She answered him coldly and composedly
enough; but he could not tell how her heart was
beating.</p>

<p>‘Strangely enough, I happened to be in New
Orleans about the time of Mr Boyd’s marriage,
and I know more about the facts of that unhappy
affair than he has probably told to any one in
England. It is enough to say that the reappearance
of this woman is the greatest misfortune that
could have happened to him. Oscar Boyd was
a miserable man before he parted from her—he
will be ten times more miserable in years to
come.’</p>

<p>‘You have not asked me to meet you here,
Sir Frederick, in order to tell me this?’</p>

<p>‘This, and something more, Lady Dimsdale.
Listen!’ He laid one finger lightly on the sleeve
of his companion’s dress, as if to emphasise her
attention. ‘I happen to be acquainted with a
certain secret—it matters not how it came into
my possession—the telling of which—and it could
be told in half-a-dozen words—would relieve Mr
Boyd of this woman at once and for ever, would
make a free man of him, as free to marry as in
those old days when he used to haunt that
vicarage garden which I too remember so well!’</p>

<p>Lady Dimsdale stopped in her walk and stared
at him with wide-open eyes. ‘You—possess—a
secret that could do all this!’</p>

<p>‘I have stated no more than the simple truth.’</p>

<p>‘Then Mr Boyd is not this woman’s husband?’
The question burst from her lips swiftly, impetuously.
Next moment her eyes fell and a tell-tale
blush suffused her cheeks. But here again the
pink-lined sunshade came to her rescue.</p>

<p>‘Mr Boyd is the husband of no other woman,’
answered the Baronet drily.</p>

<p>‘With what object have you made <i>me</i> the
recipient of this confidence, Sir Frederick?’</p>

<p>‘That I will presently explain. You are
probably aware that Mr Boyd leaves for London
by the next train?’</p>

<p>Lady Dimsdale bowed.</p>

<p>‘So that if my information is to be made available
at all, no time must be lost.’</p>

<p>‘I still fail to see why—— But that does not
matter. As you say, there is no time to lose.
You will send for Mr Boyd at once, Sir Frederick.
You are a generous-minded man, and you will
not fail to reveal to him a secret which so nearly
affects the happiness of his life.’ She spoke to
him appealingly, almost imploringly.</p>

<p>He smiled a coldly disagreeable smile. ‘Pardon
me, Lady Dimsdale, but generosity is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">{90}</span>
those virtues which I have never greatly cared
to cultivate. Had I endeavoured to do so, the
soil would probably have proved barren, and the
results not worth the trouble. In any case, I
have never tried. I am a man of the world,
that, and nothing more.’</p>

<p>‘But this secret, Sir Frederick—as between
man and man, as between one gentleman and
another—you will not keep it to yourself? You
will not. No! I cannot believe that of you.’</p>

<p>He lifted his hat for a moment. ‘Lady Dimsdale
flatters me.’ Then he glanced at his watch.
‘Later even than I thought. This question must
be decided at once, or not at all. Lady Dimsdale,
I am willing to reveal my secret to Mr Boyd on
one condition—and on one only.’</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, being still utterly
at a loss to imagine why the Baronet had taken
her so strangely into his confidence. Then she
said: ‘May I ask what the condition in question
is, Sir Frederick?’</p>

<p>‘It was to tell it to you that I asked you to
favour me with your presence here. Lady Dimsdale,
my one condition is this: That when this
man—this Mr Oscar Boyd—shall be free to marry
again, as he certainly will be when my secret
becomes known to him—you shall never consent
to become his wife, and that you shall never
reveal to him the reason why you decline to
do so.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! This to me! Sir Frederick Pinkerton,
you have no right to assume—— Nothing,
nothing can justify this language!’</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen her look so
beautiful as she looked at that moment, with
flashing eyes, heaving bosom, and burning
cheeks.</p>

<p>He bowed and spread out his hands deprecatingly.
‘Pardon me, but I have assumed nothing—nothing
whatever. I have specified a certain
condition as the price of my secret. Call that
condition a whim—the whim of an eccentric
elderly gentleman, who, having no wife to keep
him within the narrow grooves of common-sense,
originates many strange ideas at times. Call it
by what name you will, Lady Dimsdale, it still
remains what it was. To apply a big word to a
very small affair—you have heard my ultimatum.’
He glanced at his watch again. ‘I shall be in
the library for the next quarter of an hour. One
word from you—Yes or No—and I shall know
how to act. On that one word hangs the future
of your friend, Mr Oscar Boyd.’ He saluted her
with one of his most ceremonious bows, and then
turned and walked slowly away.</p>

<p>There was a garden-seat close by, and to this
Lady Dimsdale made her way. She was torn
by conflicting emotions. Indignation, grief,
wonder, curiosity, each and all held possession of
her. ‘Was ever a woman forced into such a
cruel position before?’ she asked herself. ‘What
can this secret be? Is that woman not his wife?
Yet Oscar recognised her as such the moment he
set eyes on her. Can it be possible that she had
a husband living when he married her, and that
Sir Frederick is aware of the fact? It is all a
mystery. Oh, how cruel, how cruel of Sir
Frederick to force me into this position! What
right has he to assume that even if Oscar were
free to-morrow, he would—— And yet—— Oh,
it is hard—hard! Why has this task been laid
upon me? He will be free, and yet he must
never know by what means. But whose happiness
ought I to think of first—his or my own? His—a
thousand times his! There is but one answer
possible, and Sir Frederick knows it. He understands
a woman’s heart. I must decide at once—now.
There is not a moment to lose. But one
answer.’ Her eyes were dry, although her heart
was full of anguish. Tears would find their way
later on.</p>

<p>She quitted her seat, and near the end of the
walk she found the same gardener that the
Baronet had made use of. She beckoned the man
to her, and as she slipped a coin into his hand,
said to him: ‘Go to Sir Frederick Pinkerton,
whom you will find in the library, and say to
him that Lady Dimsdale’s answer is “Yes.”’</p>

<p>The man scratched his head and stared at her
open-mouthed; so, for safety’s sake, she gave him
the message a second time. Then he seemed
to comprehend, and touching his cap, set off at
a rapid pace in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>Lady Dimsdale took the same way slowly,
immersed in bitter thoughts. ‘Farewell, Oscar,
farewell!’ her heart kept repeating to itself. ‘Not
even when you are free, must you ever learn
the truth.’</p>


<p class="p2">Meanwhile, Mrs Boyd, after lunching heartily
with kind, chatty Mrs Bowood to keep her company,
and after arranging her toilet, had gone
back to the room in which her husband had left
her, and from which he had forbidden her to
stir till his return. She was somewhat surprised
not to find him there, but quite content to wait
till he should think it well to appear. There was
a comfortable-looking couch in the room, and
after a hearty luncheon on a warm day, forty
winks seem to follow as a natural corollary; at
least that was Estelle’s view of the present state of
affairs. But before settling down among the soft
cushions of the couch, she went up to the glass
over the chimney-piece, and taking a tiny box
from her pocket, opened it, and, with the swan’s-down
puff which she found therein, just dashed
her cheeks with the faintest possible <i>soupçon</i> of
Circassian Bloom, and then half rubbed it off with
her handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘A couple of glasses of champagne would have
saved me the need of doing this; but your cold
thin claret has neither soul nor fire in it,’ she
remarked to herself. ‘How comfortable these
English country-houses are. I should like to stay
here for a month. Only the people are so very
good and, oh! so very stupid, that I know I
should tire of them in a day or two, and say
or do something that would make them fling
up their hands in horror.’ She yawned, gave
a last glance at herself, and then went and sat
down on the couch. As she was re-arranging
the pillows, she found a handkerchief under one
of them. She pounced on it in a moment. In
one corner was a monogram. She read the letters,
‘L. D.,’ aloud. ‘My Lady Dimsdale’s, without
a doubt,’ she said. ‘Damp, too. She has been
crying for the loss of her darling Oscar.’ She
dropped the handkerchief with a sneer and set
her foot on it. ‘How sweet it is to have one’s
rival under one’s feet—sweeter still, when you
know that she loves him and you don’t! Lady
Dimsdale will hardly care to let Monsieur Oscar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">{91}</span>
kiss her again. He is going away on a long
journey with his wife—with his wife, ha, ha!
Fools! If they only knew!’ The echo of her
harsh, unwomanly laugh had scarcely died away,
when the door opened, and the man of whom she
had been speaking stood before her.</p>

<p>After bidding farewell to Lady Dimsdale, Mr
Boyd had plunged at once into a lonely part
of the grounds, where he would be able to recover
himself in some measure, unseen by any one.
Of a truth, he was very wretched. It seemed
almost impossible to believe that one short hour—nay,
even far less than that—should have sufficed
to plunge him from the heights of felicity into the
lowest depths of misery. Yet, so it was; and
thus, alas, it is but too often in this world of
unstable things. But the necessity for action
was imminent upon him; there would be time
enough hereafter for thinking and suffering. A
few minutes sufficed to enable him to lock down
his feelings beyond the guess or ken of others,
and then he went in search of Captain Bowood.
He found his host and Mrs Bowood together. The
latter was telling her husband all about her recent
interview with Mrs Boyd. The mistress of Rosemount
had never had a bird of such strange
plumage under her roof before, and had rarely
been so puzzled as she was to-day. That this
woman was a lady, Mrs Bowood’s instincts declined
to let her believe; but the fact that she was Mr
Boyd’s wife seemed to prove that she must be
something better than an adventuress. The one
certain fact was, that she was a guest at Rosemount,
and as such must be made welcome.</p>

<p>When Mr Boyd entered the room, Mrs Bowood
was at once struck by the change in his appearance.
She felt instinctively that some great
calamity had overtaken this man, and her motherly
heart was touched. Accordingly, when Mr Boyd
intimated to her and the Captain that it was
imperatively necessary that he and his wife should
start for London by the five o’clock train, she
gave expression to her regret that such a necessity
should have arisen, but otherwise offered no opposition
to the proposed step, as, under ordinary
circumstances, she would have been sure to do.
In matters such as these, the Captain always
followed his wife’s lead. Five minutes later,
Oscar Boyd went in search of his wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_ST_PETERS">IN ST PETER’S.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> have spent a winter in Rome is so common
an experience for English people, that it seems
as if there were nothing new to be said about it,
nothing out of the ordinary routine to be done
during its course. We all know we must lodge
in or near the Piazza di Spagna; must make the
round of the studios; drive on the Pincio; go
to the Trinità to hear the nuns sing; have an
audience of the Holy Father; drink the Trevi
water; muse in the Colosseum; wander with
delighted bewilderment through the sculpture-galleries
of the Vatican; explore the ruins on
the Palatine; get tickets for the Cercola Artistica;
attend Sunday vespers at St Peter’s; and
tire ourselves to death amongst the three hundred
and odd churches, each one with some special
attraction, which forbids us to slight it. These
things are amongst the unwritten laws of travel;
English, Americans, and Germans are impelled
alike by a curious instinct of duty to carry them
out to the letter. In so doing, they jostle one
another perpetually, see over and over again the
same faces, hear the same remarks, and alas!
find only the same ideas. But notwithstanding
this, there are yet undiscovered corners in the old
city, and many quaint ceremonies are unknown
to or overlooked by the <i>forestieri</i>. An account
of some of these latter may perhaps be found
interesting.</p>

<p>A few winters ago, we learned, through the
politeness of a cardinal’s secretary, that certain
services well worth attending would take place
in St Peter’s, commencing at about half-past seven
on the mornings of the Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday in Holy-week. These were the consecration
of the chrism used in baptism and the
oil for extreme unction, the commemoration of
the death and passion of our Lord, and the
kindling of the fire for lighting the lamps extinguished
on Holy-Thursday. As no public notice
is given of the hours of these ceremonies, we were
glad of the information.</p>

<p>The ‘functions’ formerly conducted in the Sistine
Chapel were transferred some years ago to
the Capello Papale, which is in St Peter’s, the
third chapel on the left-hand side of the nave.
It is extremely small and inconvenient, being
almost entirely taken up with stalls for the
cardinals, bishops, canons, and vicars lay and
choral. The pope’s own choir always sing here,
but are assembled in full strength only on festivals;
then, however, their exquisite unaccompanied
singing is well worth hearing, and in the
year of which we speak, the soprani and alti were
specially good. On Holy-Thursday there is scarcely
any cessation of worship in the great church all
day; and at 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we are barely in time to
watch the assembling of the functionaries who
are to assist at the ceremony of the consecration
of the oil. The chrism used in baptism is composed
of balsam and oil; and this and the oil for
holy unction are considered extremely precious;
bishops and other dignitaries journey long distances
to procure it, and convey it to their respective
dioceses and benefices. Their appearance adds
not a little to the effect of the usual assemblage
of canons of St Peter’s, for their vestments are
much more varied in colour; the canons wearing
always violet silk robes, and gray or white fur
capes when not officiating; and their soft hue
makes an excellent background for the brilliant
scarlet trains of the cardinals, two of whom are
lighting up the corner stalls with their crimson
magnificence.</p>

<p>A number of seats take up the space in the
middle of the chapel, and are arranged in a square,
having a table in the centre. The choir presently
commence singing a Latin hymn, and a glittering
procession of canons and heads of orders enters;
they take their places in the square; the chalices
with the oil and the balsam of the chrism are
placed on the table, and the officiating cardinal
begins the ceremony. He is an exceedingly handsome
man, very tall, with clearly cut features,
and walks in a magnificent fashion; his great
white silk cope, stiff with its embroidery of gold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">{92}</span>
silver, and precious stones, seems no encumbrance
to him, and he looks a fitting president for this
august meeting. The cardinal blesses the first of
the chalices presented to him, saying the words
of benediction in clear distinct tones, the singing
meanwhile continuing softly while he lays his
hands on all the cups placed before him. Then
the choir cease, and each cardinal, bishop, priest,
and canon kneels in turn before the table, saying
three times, ‘Ave sancta chrisma.’ The sounds
of the different voices in which the words are
said, as their various old, young, short, tall, fat,
or thin owners pronounce them, have a somewhat
odd effect, and it is a relief when the lovely singing
is resumed, while the cardinal’s clear tones pronounce
blessings on the oil for extreme unction.
After this, the same ceremony is repeated, except
that the words three times said are, ‘Ave sanctum
oleum.’ As there are at least one hundred and
thirty persons to perform this act of devotion,
the service becomes a little tedious; and if it were
not for the novelty, the exquisite singing, and the
wonderful effects of light and colour in the glowing
morning atmosphere, we should not have been
surprised at the absence of our compatriots; but
there is a sense of freshness and strangeness in
the service which makes us wonder the chapel
is not crowded. The small congregation consists
of flower-sellers, women in black veils—who
always belong to the middle classes—beggars, and
shopkeepers from the long street leading to St
Peter’s. The magnificent gathering of officiating
priests makes the smallness of the attendance more
noticeable.</p>

<p>After the consecration service, a mass is celebrated,
and during the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>, the bells
are rung for the last time till Saturday.</p>

<p>No mass is sung on Good-Friday; therefore, two
hosts are consecrated on Holy-Thursday, one of
which is placed in a magnificent jewelled pyx,
and carried in procession to a niche beneath an
altar in a side-chapel; the beautiful hymn, <i>Pange
lingua</i>, being sung the while. The niche is called
a ‘sepulchre,’ and is covered with gold and silver
ornaments, and glitters with candles. All coverings
are removed from the altars, and all lights
put out on this day, the next ceremony to the
mass being that of stripping and washing the
high-altar. The bare marble of the great table
is exposed, and those who have taken part in
the earlier ‘functions,’ walk in procession, and
stand in a circle round it; acolytes carrying purple
glass bottles pour on it something that smells like
vinegar; and each dignitary, being provided with
a tiny brush made of curled shavings, goes in turn
to sweep the surface, places his brush on a tray,
takes a sponge, with which he rubs the marble,
and finally replaces that by a napkin, with which
it is dried. By this time the morning is well on;
the worshippers and onlookers in the great church
are many; but there is no crowding or pushing.
As the space is so vast, that all who wish can see,
a few of the functionaries who keep order are
quite enough to make things go easily.</p>

<p>At all these services, we are much impressed
by the extreme ease with which everything is
conducted. There is a ‘master of ceremonies,’ and
he, one fancies, must have held rehearsals; for
from the officiating cardinal to the smallest
acolyte, no one ever moves at the wrong time,
or steps into the wrong place; yet the marching
and counter-marching, the handing, giving,
placing, taking, involved in such an elaborate
ceremonial must require nice and careful arrangement
and extreme foresight. The dresses of the
priests who assist at these functions are violet
cassocks, and very short surplices edged with lace,
plaited into folds of minute patterns, involving
laundry-work of no mean description. Other
priests, and all bishops and monsignore, wear the
same coloured cassocks, but with the addition of
red pipings on cuffs and collars and fronts.</p>

<p>The function of the ‘washing of the altar’
being ended, there is a pause; and one cannot
but imagine that the cardinal retires to the great
sacristy with a feeling of relief that the pageant
is over for the time. The procession winds away
to the left, and disappears through the gray marble
doors of the sacristy; and we go home to lunch,
feeling as if we had been spending a morning
with our ancestors of three centuries back. The
doings of the last four or five hours do not
seem to agree with the appearance of the Via
Babuino as our old coachman rattles us up to
the door of our lodgings.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we are again in St Peter’s;
this time, to find it almost crowded. At
three, the ‘holy relics’ are exposed. These
are—the handkerchief given by St Veronica
to the Saviour as He passed on His way to
the cross, and on which there is said to be the
impression of His face; the lance with which
His side was pierced; the head of St Andrew;
and a portion of the true cross. They are presented
to the public gaze from a balcony at an
immense height, on one of the four great buttresses
which support the dome. There is a rattle of
small drums, and priests with white vestments
appear on the balcony, holding up certain magnificent
jewelled caskets of different shapes, amidst
the dazzling settings of which it is quite impossible
to recognise any object in particular. The
kneeling throng, the vast dim church, the clouds
of incense, the roll of drums, the sudden appearance
of the glittering figures on the balcony, their
disappearance, followed by the noise of the crowds
as they quickly move and talk, after the dead
silence during the exposure of the objects of
veneration, combine to make this a most striking
and impressive scene. Then, in the Capello
Papale, follows the service of the Tenebræ, as it
is called, with the singing of the Lamentations
and the Miserere. The quietness of the now
densely packed crowd, the soft music, and the
glimmer of the few lights left in the dim chapel,
strike one with a novel effect, after the somewhat
careless and florid services usually conducted
here.</p>

<p>Emerging thence, the vast space of the cathedral
looks larger than ever in the twilight, and the
brilliant line of lights round the shrine of St
Peter seem to glitter with double lustre; these,
however, with all others, are soon extinguished,
and the great basilica remains in darkness with
covered crucifixes and stripped altars till Saturday
morning. The ‘crowd’ as it seemed within the
small chapel, appears nothing outside, and one
by one the listeners disappear through the heavy
leathern curtain that screens the door, finding by
contrast the great piazza a scene of brilliant light,
but quiet with what seems a strange stillness in
the midst of a crowded city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">{93}</span></p>

<p>On Good-Friday morning we are again in the
Pope’s Chapel at half-past seven, and are in time
to see the canons take their places in the stalls.
Three priests, habited only in black cassock, and
close surplice with no lace edging, advance to the
altar and begin the service. The first part of this
consists simply of a reading in Latin of the whole
of the chapters from the gospel of St John which
relate to the passion. The priests take different
parts: one reads most beautifully the narrative;
another speaks the words uttered by our Saviour;
the third, those used by Pilate; and the choir
repeat the words of the populace. It is startling
in its simplicity, but wonderfully dramatic;
the dignified remonstrances of Pilate, and the
clear elocution of the reader of the history,
making up an impressive service, not the least
part of its strangeness consisting in the fact
of there being no congregation; not a dozen persons
besides the priests and canons are present
in the chapel. This ended, the officiating bishop,
who is clothed in purple vestments embroidered
with gold, kneels in prayer before the altar,
while the priests prostrate themselves. The
bishop then rises; and the choir chant softly in
a minor key while he takes the crucifix from the
altar, uncovers it, and holds it up to the people.
In the afternoon, the relics are exposed, Lamentations
and Miserere sung after Tenebræ, as on
the preceding days; but the church is dark,
bare, and silent.</p>

<p>The gloom of Friday is forgotten in the brilliant
sunshine of Saturday morning, and we feel
inspired with the freshness and life of a new
day, as we once more gain the great steps leading
to the basilica, watch the rainbow on the
fountains, and the dancing lights in the waters
of the large basins in the piazza. The obelisk
in the centre is tipped with red gold, and the
clear blue sky makes the figures on the <i>loggia</i>
and colonnades stand out with lifelike distinctness.
This morning we are called to join in an
unquestionable festival, the early ceremonial of
rekindling the lights being one of the most
cheerful ‘functions’ in which it is possible to
participate.</p>

<p>This service commences outside the cathedral;
and ascending the steps to the <i>loggia</i> or porch,
we find it already occupied by an imposing array
of priests and bishops. The handsome cardinal
again officiates; he is seated with his back to the
piazza, just within the pillars of the porch, and
facing the brazen centre-doors of the church.
In front of him is an enormous brasier, in which
burns a bright fire of coals, branches, and leaves,
which has been lighted by a spark struck from
a flint outside the church. He wears magnificent
purple and gold vestments; his finely embroidered
cope and jewelled mitre glitter in the sun.
Around him are acolytes, some of whom tend
the fire, while others carry censers; priests,
canons, and bishops all gorgeously apparelled,
and performing their parts in the service with
the usual precision and alacrity. Two priests
stand with their backs to the great bronze doors;
one bearing a massive gold cross, the other
holding a bamboo with a transverse bar on the
top, and on this are three candles. After some
chanting, the cardinal rises; and an acolyte fills
a censer with live coals from the brasier, and
brings it for benediction; another presents five
large cones of incense covered with gold; these
are also blessed and sprinkled with holy-water;
then incense is put on the hot ashes in the censer;
and as the smoke ascends, the great bronze doors,
so rarely unclosed, are thrown open, and the
procession enters the cathedral. The effect is
strangely beautiful. The lovely early morning
light and sunshine, the great building empty of
living thing, the gorgeous procession throwing a
line of brilliant colour into the dim soft mist of
the nave, the choir chanting as the priests walk,
their voices echoing in the great space—all form
a combination which must touch the least impressionable
spectator, and which cannot but be
photographed on the memory to its smallest detail.
At the door, there is a pause while one of the
candles on the bamboo is lighted; a second flame
is kindled in the nave, and the third at the altar
in the choir chapel. Thence, light is immediately
sent to the other churches in Rome, where
also darkness has reigned since Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>A venerable canon now ascends a platform, and
from a very high desk reads some chapters, recites
prayers, and then lights the great Easter candle
which stands beside him. This is a huge pillar
of wax, decorated with beautifully painted wreaths
of flowers, and is placed in a magnificent silver
candlestick. He takes the five cones of incense
which the cardinal had blessed in the porch, and
fixes them on the candle in the form of a cross.
During his reading, the candles and lamps all
over the church are relighted, and when it is
over, all who formed the procession, bearing
bouquets of lovely flowers, and small brushes like
those used on Holy-Thursday, march to the
baptistery, where the cardinal blesses the font,
pours on the water in the huge basin chrism and
oil, and sprinkles water to the four points of the
compass—typifying the quarters of the globe.</p>

<p>On the return of the procession to the choir
chapel, the cardinal and others prostrate themselves
before the altar while some beautiful
litanies are chanted. Then follows a pause,
during which the priests retire to the sacristy
to take off their embroidered vestments. They
return wearing only surplices edged with handsome
lace over their cassocks. The cardinal has
a plain cope of white silk and gold.</p>

<p>After this, is the mass; and at the <i>Gloria</i> the bells
ring out a grand peal, all pictures are uncovered,
and the organ is played for the first time during
many days. The great church resumes its wonted
cheerful aspect, and light and colour hold again
their places.</p>

<p>The afternoon ceremonies consist only of a
procession of the cardinal to worship at special
altars, the display of the holy relics, and the
singing of a fine <i>Alleluia</i> and psalm, instead of
the usual vespers.</p>

<p>Some pause is needed, one feels, before the
cathedral is filled by the crowds who attend the
Easter-Sunday mass; for no greater contrast can
be imagined than that between the scenes of the
quiet morning functions, with the numerous
priests and few people, the stillness and peace
of the hours we have been describing, and those
enacted by the thronging crowds of foreign sightseers
at the great festivals, who, pushing, gesticulating,
standing on tiptoe, and asking irrelevant
questions in audible voices, seem to look on these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">{94}</span>
sacred services as spectacles devised for their
gratification, rather than as expressions of the
worship of a large section of their fellow-creatures;
thus exemplifying the rapidity with which ignorance
becomes irreverence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AMONG_THE_ADVERTISERS_AGAIN">AMONG THE ADVERTISERS AGAIN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> it ever be said that there is nothing in the
papers, when advertisers are always to the fore,
providing matter for admiration, wonder, amusement,
or speculation? One day a gentleman
announces the loss of his heart between the stalls
and boxes of the Haymarket Theatre; the next,
we have ‘R. N.’ telling ‘Dearest E.’—‘If you
have the slightest inclination to become first-mate
on board the screw-steamer, say so, and I will
ask papa;’ and by-and-by we are trying to guess
how the necessity arose for the following: ‘St
James’s Theatre, Friday.—The Gentleman to
whom a Lady offered her hand, apologises for not
being able to take it.’</p>

<p>Does any one want two thousand pounds?
That nice little sum is to be obtained by merely
introducing a certain New-Yorker to ‘the Pontess;’
or if he or she be dead, to his or her heirs. ‘There
is a doubt whether the cognomen was, or is, borne
by a woman, a man, or a child; if by the last,
it must have been born prior to the spring of
1873.’ If the Pontess-seeker fails in his quest
from not knowing exactly what it is that he
wants, an advertiser in the <i>Times</i> is likely to
have the same fortune from knowing, and letting
those interested know, exactly what it is that he
does not want. Needing the services of a married
pair as coachman and cook, this outspoken gentleman
stipulates that the latter must not grumble
at her mistress being her own housekeeper; nor
expect fat joints to be ordered to swell her perquisites;
nor be imbued with the idea that
because plenty may be around, she is bound to
swell the tradesmen’s bills by as much waste as
possible. ‘No couple need apply that expect the
work to be put out, are fond of change, or who
dictate to their employers how much company
may be kept.’</p>

<p>When two of a trade fall out, they are apt to
disclose secrets which it were wiser to keep to
themselves. Disgusted by the success of a rival
whose advertising boards bore the representation
of a venerable man sitting cross-legged at his work,
a San Francisco tailor advertised: ‘Don’t be humbugged
by hoary-headed patriarchs who picture
themselves cross-legged, and advertise pants made
to order, three, four, and five dollars a pair. Do
you know how it’s done? When you go into one
of these stores that cover up their shop-windows
with sample lengths of cassimere, marked “Pants
to order, three dollars fifty cents and four dollars;”
after you have made a selection of the piece
of cloth you want your pants made from, the
pompous individual who is chief engineer of the
big tailor shears, lays them softly on the smoothest
part of his cutting-table, unrolls his tape-line,
and proceeds to measure his victim all over the
body. The several measurements are all carefully
entered in a book by the other humbug. The
customer is then told that his pants will be
finished in about twenty-four or thirty-six hours;
all depends upon how long it takes to shrink the
cloth. That’s the end of the first act. Part
second.—The customer no sooner leaves the store
than the merchant-tailor calls his shopboy Jim,
and sends him around to some wholesale jobber,
and says: “Get me a pair of pants, pattern thirty-six,”
which is the shoddy imitation of the piece
of cassimere that your pants are to be made of.
“Get thirty-four round the waist, and thirty-three
in the leg.” They are pulled out of a pile of a
hundred pairs just like them, made by Chinese
cheap labour. All the carefully made measurements
and other claptrap are the bait on the hook.
That’s the way it’s done.’</p>

<p>Traders sometimes give themselves away, as
Americans say, innocently enough, a Paris
grocer advertising Madeira at two francs, Old
Madeira at three francs, and genuine Madeira
at ten francs, a bottle. A Bordeaux wine-merchant,
after stating the price per cask and bottle
of ‘the most varied and superior growths of
Bordeaux and Burgundy,’ concludes by announcing
that he has also a stock of natural wine to
be sold by private treaty. A sacrificing draper
funnily tempts ladies to rid him of three hundred
baptiste robes by averring ‘they will not last over
two days;’ and the proprietor of somebody’s
Methuselah Pills can give them no higher praise
than, ‘Thousands have taken them, and are living
still.’</p>

<p>When continental advertisers, bent upon
lightening British purses, rashly adventure to
attack Englishmen in their own tongue, the
result is often disastrously comical. The proprietor
of a ‘milk-cur’ establishment in Aix-la-Chapelle,
‘foundet before twenty years of orders
from the magistrat,’ boasts that his quality of
‘Suisse and his experiences causes him to deliver
a milk pure and nutritive, obtained by sounds
cow’s and by a natural forage.’ One Parisian
hosier informs his hoped-for patrons he possesses
patent machinery for cutting ‘sirths’—Franco-English,
we presume, for shirts. Another proclaims
his resolve to sell his wares dirty cheap;
and a dealer in butter, eggs, and cheeses, whose
‘produces’ arrive every day ‘from the farms of
the establishment without intermedial,’ requests
would-be customers to send orders by unpaid
letters, as ‘the house does not recognise any
traveller.’ A Hamburg firm notifies that their
‘universal binocle of field is also preferable for
the use in the field, like in the theatre, and had
to the last degree of perfection concerning to
rigouressness and pureness of the glass;’ while
they are ready to supply all comers with ‘A
Glass of Field for the Marine 52ctm opjectiv
opening in extra shout lac-leather étui and strap,
at sh 35s 6d.’ This is a specimen of their ‘English
young man’s’ powers of composition that would
justify the enterprising opticians in imitating the
Frenchman whose shop-window was graced with
a placard, bearing the strange device, ‘English
spoken here a few.’</p>

<p>An Italian, speaking French well and a little
English, with whom ‘wage is no object,’ advertising
in a London paper for an engagement as
an indoor servant, puts down his height as ‘fifty-seven
feet seven.’ But he manages his little
English to better purpose than his countryman of
Milan, who offers the bestest comforts to travellers,
at his hotel, which he describes as ‘situated in the
centre of an immence parck, with most magnificient
views of the Alp chain, and an English church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">{95}</span>
residing in the hotel’—the latter being furthermore
provided with ‘baths of mineral waters
in elegant private cabins and shower rooms,
and two basins for bathin’; one for gentlemen,
the oter for ladies;’ while it contains a hundred
and fifty rooms, ‘all exposed to the south-west
dining-groom.’</p>

<p>Such an exposure might well cause the Milanese
host’s visitors to become ‘persons dependent upon
the headache, or who have copious perspirations,’
whom a M. Lejeune invites ‘to come and visit
without buying his new fabrication,’ with the
chance of meeting ‘the hat-makers, who endeavour
by caoutchouc, gummed linen and others, to prevent
hats from becoming dirt;’ eager to hear
the inventor of the new fabrication demonstrate
‘how much all those preparations are injurious,
and excite, on contrary, to perspiration.’ Equally
anxious to attract British custom is a doctor-dentist
who, ‘after many years consecrated to
serious experiences, has perfected the laying of
artificial teeth by wholly new proceedings. He
makes himself most difficulty works; it is the
best guaranty, and, thanks to his peculiar proceeding,
his work joins to elegancy, solidity, and
duration.’ Considering all things, our doctor-dentist’s
derangement of sentences is quite as
commendable as that of the Belfast gentleman
desirous of letting ‘the House at present occupied,
and since erected by J. H——, Esq.;’ who might
pair off with the worthy responsible for—‘To
be sold, <i>six</i> cows—No. 1, a beautiful cow, calved
eight days, with splendid calf at foot, a good
milker; No. 2, a cow to calve in about fourteen
days, and great promise. The <i>other two</i> cows are
calved about twenty-one days, and <i>will speak for
themselves</i>.’</p>

<p>By a fortuitous concurrence of antagonistic
lines, the <i>Times</i> one morning gave mothers the
startling information that</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Joseph Gillott’s Steel Pens<br />
The Best Food for Infants<br />
Is Prepared solely by<br />
Savory and Moore</span><br />
</p>

<p>—a hint as likely to be taken as that of a public
benefactor who announced in the <i>Standard</i>:
‘Incredible as it may seem, I have ground to
hope that half a glass of cold water, taken
immediately after every meal, will be found to
be the divinely appointed antidote for every kind
of medicine.’</p>

<p>Another benevolent individual kindly tells us
how to make coffee:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed in the parted straining-top let stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moistened coffee, till the grain expand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the fire; then boiling water pour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And quaff the nectar of the Indian shore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But he is not quite so generous as he seems, since
he is careful to inform us he is in possession
of an equally excellent recipe for bringing out
the flavour of tea, which he will forward for five
shillings-worth of stamps. Urged by an equally
uncontrollable desire to serve his fellow-creatures,
a ‘magister in palmystery and conditionalist’
offers, with the aid of guardian spirits, to obtain
for any one a glimpse at the past and present;
and, on certain conditions, of the future; but
with less wisdom than a magister of palmystery
should display, he winds up with the prosaic
notification, ‘Boots and shoes made to order.’</p>

<p>The wants of the majority of advertisers are
intelligible enough; but it needs some special
knowledge to understand what may be meant
by the good people who hanker for a portable
mechanic, an efficient handwriter, a peerless feeder,
a first-class ventilator on human hair-nets, a
practical cutter by measure on ladies’ waists, a
youth used to wriggling, and a boy to kick
Gordon. Nor is the position required by a
respectable young lady as ‘figure in a large
establishment,’ altogether clear to our mind; and
we may be doing injustice to the newspaper
proprietor requiring ‘a sporting compositor,’ by
inferring he wants a man clever alike at ‘tips’
and types.</p>

<p>It does not say much for American theatrical
‘combinations,’ that the managers of one of them
ostentatiously proclaim: ‘We pay our salaries
regularly every Tuesday; by so doing, we avoid
lawsuits, are not compelled to constantly change
our people, and always carry our watches in our
pockets.’ Neither would America appear to be
quite such a land of liberty as it is supposed to
be, since a gentleman advertises his want of a
furnished room where he can have perfect independence;
while we have native testimony to
our cousins’ curiosity in a quiet young lady
desiring a handsome furnished apartment ‘with
non-inquisitive parties;’ and a married couple
seeking three or four furnished rooms ‘for very
light housekeeping, where people are not inquisitive.’
Can it be the same pair who want a competent
Protestant girl ‘to take entire charge of
a bottled baby?’ If so, their anxiety to abide
with non-curious folk is easily comprehended.</p>

<p>Very whimsical desires find expression in the
advertising columns of the day. A lady of companionable
habits, wishing to meet with a lady
or gentleman requiring a companion, would prefer
to act as such to ‘one who, from circumstances,
is compelled to lead a retired life.’ A stylish and
elegant widow, a good singer and musician, possessing
energy, business knowledge, and means
of her own, ready, ‘for the sake of a social home,’
to undertake the supervision of a widower’s establishment,
thinks it well to add, goodness knows
why, ‘a Radical preferred.’ Somebody in search
of a middle-aged man willing to travel, stipulates
for a misanthrope with bitter experience of the
wickedness of mankind; displaying as pleasant
a taste as the proprietor of a wonderful discovery
for relieving pain and curing disease without
medicine, who wants a partner in the shape of
a consumptive or asthmatical gentleman.</p>

<p>Your jocular man, lacking an outlet for his
wit, will often pay for the privilege of airing his
humour in public. Here are a few examples.
‘Wanted, a good Liberal candidate for the
Kilmarnock Burghs. Several inferior ones given
in exchange.’—‘Wanted a Thin Man who has been
used to collecting debts, to crawl through keyholes
and find debtors who are never at home.
Salary, nothing the first year; to be doubled each
year afterwards.’—‘Wanted, Twelve-feet planks
at the corners of all the streets in Melbourne,
until the Corporation can find some other means
of crossing the metropolitan creeks. The planks
and the Corporation may be tied up to the lamp-posts
in the dry weather.’—‘Wanted, a Cultured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">{96}</span>
Gentleman used to milking goats; a University
man preferred.’—‘Correspondence is solicited from
Bearded Ladies, Circassians, and other female
curiosities, who, in return for a true heart and
devoted husband, would travel during the summer
months, and allow him to take the money at the
door.’—‘Wanted, a Coachman, the ugliest in the
city; he must not, however, have a moustache
nor red hair, as those are very taking qualities
in certain households at present. As he will
not be required to take care of his employer’s
daughter, and is simply engaged to see to the
horses, he will only be allowed twenty dollars per
month.’</p>

<p>A great deal might be said about pictorial
advertisements, if the impossibility of reproducing
them did not stand in the way. As it is, we
must content ourselves with showing how an
advertisement can be illustrated without the help
of draughtsman or engraver. By arranging ordinary
printers’ types thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p_096" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p_096.jpg" alt="Punctation symbols arranged to look like faces" />
</div>

<p>an ingenious advertising agent presents the public
with portraits of the man who does not and the
man who does advertise, and says: ‘Try it, and
see how you will look yourself.’</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_STRANGE_INSTITUTION">A STRANGE INSTITUTION.</h2>
</div>


<p>Amongst the oral traditions of the past in
Cambridge, there is handed down to the modern
undergraduate an account of a secret Society
which was established in the university at a
remote period of time, and which was called the
Lie Society. At the weekly meetings of the
members, an ingenious falsehood was fabricated,
which frequently referred to some person locally
known, and which was probably not altogether
free from scandal. It was the duty of all the
members to propagate this invented story as
much as possible by relating it to every one they
met. Each member had to make a note of the
altered form in which the lie thus circulated
came round to him individually, and these were
read out at the next meeting with all the copious
additions and changes the story had received
passing from one to the other, often to such an
extent as to leave but little of the original
fabric left. After a time the Society began
to languish, and soon after disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>In the dim past, and before the present
stringent regulations were made as to examinations
in the Senate House, another secret Society
was organised, called the Beavers, which was for
the purpose of enabling members, when being
examined, to help each other by a system of
signals. With this view, one of the members of
the Beavers was told off by lot to perform
various duties assigned to him, such as engaging
the attention of the examiners, and giving information
as to the papers by preconcerted signs.
This Society soon collapsed. To one of its
members is credited the ingenious watch-faced
Euclid, and the edition of Little-go-classics on
sleeve-links.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
